# Developer documentation for nRF Connect for Desktop

This repository documents how to develop nRF Connect for Desktop: If you want to
create a new app for it, modify an existing app or modify the core of nRF
Connect for Desktop itself.

This documentation can be read online at
https://NordicPlayground.github.io/pc-nrfconnect-docs/.

## Modifying the documentation

If you want to preview any changes locally before submitting them to the repo
you should set up Jekyll locally. You can read and follow the
[instructions on how to set up GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
but they mainly boil down to these steps:

1. Make sure you have a recent ruby.
2. If you have not already bundler installed, run `gem install bundler`.
3. Run `gem install bundler` once inside this repo folder.
4. Each time you want to view your local files run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
   and go to `http://localhost:4000`.
