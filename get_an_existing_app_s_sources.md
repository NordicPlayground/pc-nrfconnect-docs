# How to get an existing app's sources

First make sure, all the needed [prerequisites](getting_started#prerequisites)
are met.

## Get app sources

Clone the project to the `~/.nrfconnect-apps/local` directory. For example, if
you want to work on the
[RSSI Viewer](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-rssi), do
this in a terminal on Linux/macOS or Git bash on Windows:

    cd $HOME/.nrfconnect-apps/local
    git clone https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-rssi

If you prefer it, you can also create the project directory anywhere else and
create a symbolic link from `~/.nrfconnect-apps/local` to the project directory.

## Next steps

You now have everything set up for
[everyday app development](./app_development), so read up about that.
