# Migrating apps

Until nRF Connect for Desktop 3.8.0 we supported a different architecture to
write apps which is now deprecated and support for it will be removed in the
next release after 3.8.0.

If you still need to convert an app using the old architecture to the new
architecture, then look at
[the old documentation to migrate apps](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-docs/blob/e9b8e835fe40230fdce30d5af384ea1621da2cb8/migrating_apps.md).
The
[API description for the old architecture](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-docs/blob/e9b8e835fe40230fdce30d5af384ea1621da2cb8/old_api_reference.md)
is also only in the repository any longer.
