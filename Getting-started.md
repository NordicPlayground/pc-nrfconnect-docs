## Prerequisites

### Recommended knowledge

nRF Connect is based on [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/). Some familiarity with React and Redux is recommended in order to create apps. You should at least understand concepts like JSX, props, actions, reducers, and state. Also, familiarity with [ECMAScript 2015](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) syntax such as arrow functions, modules, const/let, and template strings is recommended.

### Install nRF Connect

Before you can create apps, you need to have nRF Connect up and running. Follow the instructions in the [project README](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-core) to either install the binaries or build it from source.

### Install development tools

Development tools required:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>=6.9)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* An editor with good JavaScript support (e.g. VS Code, Atom, WebStorm)

## Create an app project

We recommend using tools like webpack, babel, eslint, and jest when creating apps. Fortunately, you do not need to configure these yourself. We have created an [nRF Connect boilerplate app](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-boilerplate) that gives you what you need to get started. Follow the instructions in the boilerplate app README to create an empty app project.
