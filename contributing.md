# Contributing

Feel free to file code and documentation related issues on GitHub Issues and/or
submit a pull request.

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to sign our Contributor
License Agreement (CLA). You will see instructions for doing this after having
submitted your first pull request. You only need to sign the CLA once, so if you
have already done it for another project in the NordicSemiconductor
organization, you are good to go.
